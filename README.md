# Image Classification using CIFAR 10 dataset

Main objective:

- to compare the strengths and weaknesses of AlexNet, ResNet-18 and EfficientNet in image classification performance, and focus on evaluating their performance based on standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, AUC curve.
- observe how slight adjustments in hyperparameters affect the model's accuracy and loss trajectories. This highlights the importance of selecting effective model and tuning hyperparameters in achieving high performance for deep learning applications.
